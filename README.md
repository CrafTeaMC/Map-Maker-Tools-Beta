# MAP MAKER TOOLS 

## BETA 1.0

[Downloand Link](https://www.mediafire.com/file/xnepr9ql3xhzxh2/Map_Maker_Tools.zip/file)(Since we could not upload files larger than 25 MB to github releases, we uploaded them to mediafire.)

### WHAT IS IT?
> It is a program that contains tools to help minecraft map makers. It is currently in beta and contains only 3 tools.

### HOW TO USE IT?
> Download and unzip the zip. Then open "launcher.exe", click 1 time on the button you want to use and wait for it to open (there are optimization problems at the moment, it may open a little late, but still click 1 time and wait).

### TOOLS:

> 1- Cinematic Generator 
> It is an automatic cutscene generator where we can add as many points as we want and adjust the time between each point. All you have to do is enter the requested information, press the "GENERATE" button and throw the resulting file into the datapack. Then when you run the "tick/start" function in the game, the cinematic starts automatically.

> 2- If Block Generator
> Automatically creates an mcfunction that tests all blocks between the 2 coordinates you enter according to the block id you enter and executes the command you enter. With this you can for example count diamond blocks in a specific area.

> 3- Item Replace
> To replace a specific item in the player's inventory with another item, it automatically creates an mcfunction file that tests all the player's slots one by one and replaces it with the item you enter.


*(it's in beta so there might be bugs, please let me know if you find bugs or if you want to suggest a tool).*
